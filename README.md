# Automated Machine Learning Pipeline

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of the Dicoding x Asah Bootcamp (Machine Learning Path).
The objective of this project is to build an automated data preprocessing pipeline
based on exploratory data analysis (EDA) using the MSML experiment template.

## 📂 Dataset
- Name: Ames Housing Dataset
- Source: Kaggle
- Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/prevek18/ames-housing-dataset
- Type: Structured data (tabular)

## 🧪 Experiment Stage
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and preprocessing were conducted in a notebook
to identify the appropriate preprocessing steps, including:
- Handling missing values
- Removing duplicates
- Encoding categorical features
- Feature scaling

## ⚙️ Automated Preprocessing
All preprocessing steps were automated using a Python script:
